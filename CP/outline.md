# PHYS60012 - Computational Physics 2022-2023 

- No teams
- No APS
- Ed discussion and wednesdays
- info on course description
- 15 lectures for first 7 weeks
- 10 practical sessions at 12am
  - ta's will present research and these classes will be dedicated to their research
  - other sessions for fleshing out knowledge
  - purpose to discuss specific PS questions
  - not for code/debugging help
  
- Office hours: thursdays 10am, Blackett 741

- project for last 4 weeks (50% course mark)
  - submit a report (6 pages)
  - code note marked! however projects are designed that better optimised code gives better results. in  the past optimisation hasn't affected marks
  - deadline Friday 16/12/22 18:00
- exam - first day of T2 (50% of mark)
- essentially topics spread out over a weekend, to apply to wednesday sessions
- **advice for packages** - write the algorithm yourself whilst studying, say matrix inversion, but when matrix inversion is used in PDEs and you're not studying matrix inversions (1 part of the algortihm) ok to use package


## Outcomes

- **teaching techniques, not how to code**
  
<!-- - identify fundamental problem types
- numerical roots of an equation
- invert matrices and solve matrix equations
- (missed the rest) -->
